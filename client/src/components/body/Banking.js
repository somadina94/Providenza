                <h2>Overdraft</h2>
                <p>
                    When you open this account, you'll have the option to take out an arranged overdraft. An arranged
                    overdraft allows you to borrow money (up to an agreed limit) if there’s no money left in your
                    account. This can be useful if you're hit with an unexpected bill, for example. If a payment would
                    take you past your arranged limit (or if you don’t have one), we may let you borrow using an
                    unarranged overdraft. There's a chance that payments you try to make using an unarranged overdraft
                    may be declined. However, we'll always try to allow essential payments if we can. You can apply for
                    an arranged overdraft when you open your account, or at any time later. You can ask to increase,
                    remove or reduce your limit at any time in online or mobile banking, by phone or in-branch. Your new
                    limit can't be less than what you owe. We report account activity, including overdraft usage, to
                    credit reference agencies. An unarranged overdraft lasting more than 30 days could have a negative
                    impact on your credit rating. Overdrafts are designed for short-term borrowing only and are subject
                    to status
